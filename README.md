## Technologies Used

- 🤖 **React**: For building the UI components.
- 🖌️ **Material-UI**: For icons and buttons.
- 🎨 **CSS**: For custom styling.

## How It Works

1. ➕ **Create Notes**: Users can add notes by filling in the title and content fields and clicking the `+` button.
2. ❌ **Delete Notes**: Each note has a delete button that removes it from the list.
3. 🔧 **State Management**: React's `useState` hook is used to manage the notes array dynamically.

## Future Enhancements

- ⚡ Add user authentication.
- 🔒 Implement local storage or a database to persist notes.
- ✍️ Enable editing of existing notes.
- 🔍 Add categories or tags for notes.
